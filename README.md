# Neural Network Project

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a neural network from scratch. The neural network was developed using Python and various machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and NumPy. The goal of the project was to build a functional neural network, apply optimization techniques, and improve model accuracy through various activation functions.

## Features

- **Custom Neural Network Implementation**: The neural network was built from the ground up, without relying on high-level frameworks, to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
  
- **Optimization Techniques**: Applied several optimization techniques to improve the network's learning process, including gradient descent, learning rate schedules, and regularization methods.
  
- **Activation Functions**: Experimented with different activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, to determine their impact on the model's performance.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessed the input data to ensure it was in the correct format and scale, which is crucial for the network's performance.
  
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning**: Performed thorough evaluation of the model using various metrics and tuned the hyperparameters to achieve the best possible accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the development of the neural network.
